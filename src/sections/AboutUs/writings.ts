      "Positive word-of-mouth spread quickly, leading to increased demand for her sweet and wonderful creations. Over the years, Sobirova has taught more than 1000 students and received recognition and applause for her outstanding skills. As a great honor, his neighborhood committee named the neighborhood Shirinlik Street in his honor. Her passion for baking started as a hobby in 2018 and turned into a thriving business thanks to great support from satisfied customers. Sobirova and her husband Mahmudov Bosit realized the growth opportunities and made a strategic decision to establish a special confectionery factory. With the valuable support of his brother Ibrahim Sobirov, they successfully launched the 'Caramella' factory. Since its establishment, Caramella has gained popularity as one of the most famous confectionery factories in Namangan. This success story would not have been possible without the dedication and hard work of important people such as Shadiya, Mashkhura, Mohidil, Mubarak, Naima. Their unwavering loyalty has been instrumental in making Caramella the popular establishment it is today. As a token of appreciation, we express our sincere thanks to these hardworking and dedicated people.",
